Check out this mind-blowing demo of ControlNet-based frame interpolation on the TurkishAirlinesðŸ›« logo, all created using open-source AI tools! ðŸ¤¯

In this video, I tried to utilize multiple Stable Diffusion/Lexica Aperture prompts sourced from Lexica Art, and created images using ControlNet Space on HuggingFaceðŸ¤— and the HED model based on StableDiffusion v1.5. ðŸŽ¨

And for the frame interpolation, we used the AI Magic Tools service from RunwayML which offers a free tier for video creation. ðŸ“½
